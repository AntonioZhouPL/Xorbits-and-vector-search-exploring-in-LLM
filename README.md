# Exploration of Xorbits Computing Framework for Data Preprocessing and Vector Search for Large Language Model

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore the application of the XORBITS computing framework in data preprocessing for large model scenarios, and to conduct an in-depth exploration of vector search techniques. Through experiments and analysis, this project seeks to offer new perspectives and solutions for large-scale data processing and efficient searching.

This project primarily references the user guide from the official Xorbits website, intended for learning and research purposes only, with no commercial value involved. Xorbits is an open-source computing framework that effortlessly scales data science and machine learning workloadsâ€”from data preprocessing to tuning, training, and model serving.
